    read_verilog [options] [filename]

Load modules from a Verilog file to the current design. A large subset of
Verilog-2005 is supported.

    -sv
        enable support for SystemVerilog features. (only a small subset
        of SystemVerilog is supported)
```

Extend yosys support to a greater subset of sv features (most _import_antly, **imports**).
