# Plan

# Step 1: Small open source module implementation
- Write systolic array simulator in Cpp
- Write systolic array in RTL
- Synthesize with Yosys
- Implement with Librelane
- Extra features?
	- DRC?
	- LVS?
	- LEC?
	- DFT?
- How do the tools work? What issues do we encounter? What can be improved?

# Next steps:
- Improve open source flow?
- Design a more complex / interesting module?

# Tools
Synthesis: Yosys

Implementation: OpenROAD/OpenLane2/Librelane

Signoff/Verification: Magic/Klayout
